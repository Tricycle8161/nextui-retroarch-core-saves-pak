# RetroArch Core Saves.pak

Tool pak for keeping NextUI saves, and optionally save states, in RetroArch core-name folders. Automatically converts `.<tag>.sav/.sav` files to RetroArch's `.srm` format and creates folders in `/mnt/SDCARD/Saves/Cores` corresponding to RetroArch Cores. Can also convert all `.<tag>.sav/.sav` files to RetroArch's `.srm` format (even compressing or decompressing them!) and vice versa (See note on Save Ownership).

After running, saves will be in:

```text
/mnt/SDCARD/Saves/Cores/<RetroArch core name>/
```

RetroArch Core Saves bind-mounts those folders onto the system-tag paths expected by
MinArch:

```text
/mnt/SDCARD/Saves/GB  -> /mnt/SDCARD/Saves/Cores/Gambatte
/mnt/SDCARD/Saves/GBC -> /mnt/SDCARD/Saves/Cores/Gambatte
/mnt/SDCARD/Saves/GBA -> /mnt/SDCARD/Saves/Cores/gpSP
```

You can then point SyncThing at `/mnt/SDCARD/Saves/Cores` without performing any manual mapping. **If Profiles.pak is installed, use the canonical path instead** — see [Profiles](#profiles). The tag folders (such as `/Saves/GB`) are runtime aliases, not duplicate save trees. When viewing the folders from the on-device file manager, they will be populated, but viewing the SD card from your computer will display empty directories.

If multiple systems sharing a core contain the same save filename, files with
different contents are preserved. The first keeps the normal filename and
additional saves use `Game.core-conflict-N.srm`. Byte-identical files reuse the
existing core save instead of creating a conflict. Because MinArch will not load
conflict names automatically, the completion dialog reports differing files and
asks you to review them.

## UI

The pak displays:

- The active profile, when Profiles.pak is installed.
- Current NextUI save format.
- Where saves currently live, as a path.
- How many installed emulators are mapped to a core, as `resolved/mappable`.
- How many configured tag folders are mounted, if any.

The Mappings row counts only emulator paks that declare an `EMU_EXE`, so a
standalone emulator that can never map is left out of the total rather than
holding it below 100% forever. `3/4` therefore means one installed libretro
emulator still needs a `mapping.conf` entry.

## Completing partial mappings

When an emulator cannot be mapped, its saves are left in `/Saves/<tag>` and the
conversion report names it. After adding the override to `mapping.conf`, reopen
the pak: while core saves are active and mappings are incomplete — or the mount
table no longer matches what discovery produces, which also covers installing or
removing an emulator pak — a **Re-apply Core Save Mappings** action appears above
**Revert to NextUI Saves**, with the cursor defaulting to it.

Re-applying runs the same migration as the initial conversion. It is safe to
repeat: systems already in `/Saves/Cores` are detected as unchanged and left
alone, so only the newly mapped ones move. The action disappears once every
mappable emulator is mapped and applied. Reverting and converting again is not
required, and should not be used for this — a full restore does ROM-name
matching that can leave shared-core saves ambiguous.

The Mounts row shows the active count. It is selectable only while at least one
bind mount is verified live in `/proc/self/mountinfo`; otherwise it is a plain
status readout, so a mount table left behind by an earlier session cannot be
opened as if it were current. When selectable, confirming it opens a read-only
detail screen showing every immediate `/Saves` folder except `Cores` beside its
mapped `/Saves/Cores` folder. Unmapped folders from either side are also shown
with a blank opposite column.

The Convert Saves screen presents the configured format as a left-aligned
`From` value and all four formats as selectable targets. The current format
remains selectable so conversion can be reapplied when actual files do not
match the setting. When Core Saves is enabled, pressing X displays the sync
compatibility warning before opening the conversion screen.

Available actions depend on current state.

## Converting to Core Saves

1. Makes a backup of saves in `.core-saves-backups`
2. Creates folders in `/Saves/Cores` corresponding to on-device emulator cores
3. Copies save files to `/Saves/Cores`
4. If necessary, converts save files to .srm (uncompressed)
5. Registers its mounts with mountctl, which mounts them at every boot
6. Mounts folders


## Core States

Save states are handled in the same conversion as saves, so a desktop RetroArch
can sync each core's states folder with Syncthing without per-system mapping.
There is one **Convert** action and one **Revert** action, one backup, one
recoverable transaction, and one mount layer; the states ride along when the
**Core States** setting is on (it is on by default).

NextUI keeps states in `.userdata/shared/<TAG>-<core>`, where `<core>` is the
emulator's core file name (`GB-gambatte`, `GBC-gambatte`, `SFC-snes9x`).
Converting moves them into one folder per core and bind-mounts that folder back
over each NextUI folder:

```text
/mnt/SDCARD/States/Cores/Gambatte/Game.state
/mnt/SDCARD/States/Cores/Gambatte/Game.state1
/mnt/SDCARD/States/Cores/Gambatte/Game.state.auto

.userdata/shared/GB-gambatte  -> /mnt/SDCARD/States/Cores/Gambatte
.userdata/shared/GBC-gambatte -> /mnt/SDCARD/States/Cores/Gambatte
```

The folders are named after the libretro library name, exactly like `/Saves/Cores`
(`Gambatte`, `Snes9x`, `gpSP`), which is the layout desktop RetroArch uses when
its states are sorted into folders by core.

**Point Syncthing at `/mnt/SDCARD/States/Cores`** (and RetroArch's states folder at
the other end), next to `/Saves/Cores` for saves. The NextUI folders under
`.userdata/shared` are runtime aliases and should not be synced themselves.

### The setting

The **Core States** row is under *State Status*. Select it to switch between On
and Off; it only changes what the next conversion includes. The row is locked
only while the running setup includes states (`On (active)`): taking states out
of a running setup is not supported, so that takes a revert and a new
conversion. A setup without states, whether it was made before Core States
existed or with the setting off, can switch the row on, and
**Re-apply Core Save Mappings** then appears and brings the states in.

### Converting

One operation, one journal, one backup, for saves and states together:

1. Backs up `/Saves`, the NextUI states folders and `minuisettings.txt`.
2. Renames and copies every state into `/States/Cores/<core>`, next to the saves
   being moved into `/Saves/Cores`.
3. Sets the NextUI state format to **RetroArch (compressed)**, and records the one
   it replaced so it can be restored.
4. Registers the mounts with mountctl's layer 20 (the same layer that mounts the
   saves) and mounts them.
5. Writes what was converted, skipped or failed to the conversion report.

If anything fails or the device stops part-way, the whole operation, saves and
states, is rolled back together the next time the pak opens.

NextUI picks up a changed format the next time a game starts, so no restart is
needed. Only file names change; the state data itself is never rewritten. MinArch
reads compressed and uncompressed states, with or without RetroArch's header, and
the format setting only decides what it writes next, so renaming is lossless and
reversible. Files that are not state names (`notes.txt`) are copied unchanged,
because the NextUI folder is hidden under the mount afterwards.

| Slot | NextUI MinUI | RetroArch-ish | RetroArch (used by Core States) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `Game.gba.st0` | `Game.state.0` | `Game.state` |
| 1 to 7 | `Game.gba.stN` | `Game.state.N` | `Game.stateN` |
| 8 (NextUI's hidden default) | `Game.gba.st8` | `Game.state.8` | `Game.state8` |
| Auto-resume | `Game.gba.st9` | `Game.state.auto` | `Game.state.auto` |

NextUI only reads manual slots 0 to 7, its hidden default in 8, and the
auto-resume state. Desktop RetroArch has more slots, so a state in slot 9 or
above is not a NextUI state: it syncs and stays in `/States/Cores`, but NextUI
cannot load it, and reverting to a NextUI format leaves it there (see below).

Existing files are sorted by their own names rather than by the setting, because
NextUI never converts old files when the setting changes. Converting is safe to
repeat: it keeps the format recorded the first time, reuses identical files and
only picks up states that appeared since. If two different files would get the
same name, both are kept and the second becomes `Game.core-conflict-N.state`.
Re-applying never lowers a state format you have switched to RetroArch
(uncompressed) in NextUI's settings, and it refuses, changing nothing, when no
mapped emulator has a states folder any more, instead of dropping the states
from a running setup.

Keep NextUI's state format on RetroArch (either one) while Core States is on.
Another format makes NextUI write names desktop RetroArch will not read; a
re-apply puts it back to RetroArch (compressed).

### Reverting

**Revert to NextUI Saves** reverses both. When the setup includes states it also
asks whether to restore the state format from before. States are copied back into
the NextUI folders and nothing is ever deleted from `/States/Cores`, because
Syncthing would propagate the deletion.

- **Restore**: puts the recorded format back and renames the states for it.
  The MinUI format needs the ROM to recover the extension, so a state without
  exactly one matching ROM cannot be named for it. When several systems share a
  core (GB and GBC), each state needs exactly one ROM match to know which system it
  belongs to. States that cannot be placed, including desktop slots 9 and above
  that no NextUI format can name, stay in `/States/Cores/<core>`, are
  listed in the conversion report, and **will not load in NextUI** until renamed.
- **Keep**: leaves the format on RetroArch and copies states back under those names.

### Backups

The conversion backup holds the saves and the NextUI states folders as they were.
The usual limit of five backups applies, with one exception: the backups the
running setup points at (the one made when it was enabled, and the one holding the
states from before Core States) are never pruned while it runs, so the originals
are still there when you revert.

### Important: states are not portable between cores

A state only loads in the same core at a compatible version. Syncing works even
when loading will not, so a state synced to a device with a different core build
(or another core for the same console) can fail to load or misbehave. The sync
moves the file; it cannot make it compatible.

Other things to know:

- The auto-resume state (`.state.auto`) is synced too. NextUI writes it when the
  device powers off, and it can reach another device before then. A RetroArch with
  auto-load-state enabled will load it, and the one from the device you powered
  off last wins.
- RetroArch writes `.png` thumbnails beside its states. They are harmless and are
  carried along, but NextUI does not use them: its slot previews and game switcher
  art are BMPs in `.userdata/shared/.minui`, which are not synced. States synced
  from another device therefore load from the menu but show no preview, and do
  not make NextUI offer Resume, which depends on those files.
- Syncing a state while the emulator is writing it can leave a partial file.

### Profiles

Core States follows Core Saves' single-owner rule, using the same ownership record
in `.profiles/core-saves-profile`: only the owner's saves and states are mounted,
other profiles cannot convert, and backups go to the active profile's backup
folder. Everything is coordinated through mountctl. `/States/Cores` is outside
`/Saves`, so the Syncthing path is the same with or without Profiles.

### Folder names and mapping

NextUI names a states folder after the emulator's core file, which is the
`EMU_EXE` of its pak. The `mapping.conf` overrides only provide the library name
used for the `/States/Cores` folder, so a tag mapped solely by an override and
with no `EMU_EXE` has no states folder that can be determined. It is reported
and left alone.

## Netplay

Netplay.pak covers an emulator pak by bind-mounting a staged copy over its
directory. The staged `launch.sh` is a wrapper that execs the original, kept
beside it as `launch.sh.old`, and the wrapper carries no `EMU_EXE` line.

`launch.sh.old` is the pak's real launcher, so Core Saves takes its `EMU_EXE`
as authoritative whenever the file is present and only falls back to the visible
`launch.sh`. A covered emulator therefore maps exactly as it does normally. Without that, every emulator Netplay covers dropped
out of discovery for as long as its mounts were up: the Mappings ratio collapsed
to whatever handful of systems Netplay does not cover, **Re-apply Core Save
Mappings** appeared and disappeared as those mounts came and went, and a
migration run at that moment would have left the covered systems' saves behind
in `/Saves/<tag>`.

`MGBA.pak`, which Netplay installs under `Emus/<platform>`, is a real libretro
emulator pak with its own bundled core, so it counts in Mappings and maps to
`/Saves/Cores/mGBA` — its own folder, separate from the stock GBA pak's
`/Saves/Cores/gpSP`. mGBA and gpSP are different cores with different save
formats, so the same ROM keeps a separate save under each. That separation is
deliberate; the two are never merged.

`NETPLAY.pak` is the game-switcher launcher rather than an emulator; it owns no
`/Saves` folder and is no longer named in the conversion report.

## Profiles

Profiles.pak bind-mounts `.profiles/<name>/Saves` onto `/Saves` at boot, so
`/Saves` and `/Saves/Cores` are the active profile's folders under a second
name — the same directories, not copies. Core Saves keeps mounting and writing
through `/Saves`, because NextUI and MinArch have that path hardcoded and the
tag aliases have to land where the emulators look for them.

What changes is what the pak reports and where it puts things that sit outside
`/Saves`:

- A **Profile** row shows the active profile. If Profiles has assigned Core
  Saves to a different profile, it shows that owner too, and the actions are
  refused until you switch back.
- **Location** shows the canonical path — `.profiles/<name>/Saves/Cores` rather
  than `/Saves/Cores`.
- Backups go to `.profiles/<name>/.core-saves-backups`. They used to share one
  SD-root folder across every profile, where the five-backup retention limit
  meant one profile's conversions could evict another's. An existing SD-root
  folder is moved into the active profile the next time the pak is opened.

Core Saves may only be enabled for one profile, which Profiles records in
`.profiles/core-saves-profile`. Both paks mount through mountctl (see
[Boot Mounts](#boot-mounts)): Profiles is layer 10 and Core Saves layer 20, so
on every switch mountctl takes the tag mounts down, swaps `/Saves`, and mounts
them again only for the owning profile. Each profile has its own enabled state,
because it lives in that profile's shared data; the layer stays installed while
any profile has Core Saves enabled and does nothing for the others.

### Syncthing with Profiles

Point Syncthing at:

```text
/mnt/SDCARD/.profiles/<name>/Saves/Cores
```

Not `/mnt/SDCARD/Saves/Cores`. Under Profiles that is a moving alias — it
points at whichever profile is active — and Profiles blocks initial setup if
Syncthing's `config.xml` contains `/Saves` or anything under it.

Scope the folder to `Cores`, not to the profile's whole `Saves` directory. The
tag bind mounts exist at `/Saves/<tag>`, so the matching
`.profiles/<name>/Saves/<tag>` folders sit empty on disk — but a peer device
that is not running Core Saves has real files in its `<tag>` folders, and those
would sync down underneath the mount where nothing can read them.

## Boot Mounts

The pak does not mount anything itself. It ships `mountctl` (`bin/mounts`), the
mount manager it shares with Profiles.pak, and enabling core saves registers
the tag mounts as mountctl's layer 20: "while enabled, mount each
`/Saves/<tag>` from `/Saves/Cores/<core>`". mountctl refuses to mount over a tag
folder that has files in it, so nothing is ever hidden. Installed on the card:

```text
.userdata/<platform>/Mounts/mountctl.sh                the newest copy any pak shipped
.userdata/<platform>/Mounts/layers.d/20-core-saves.sh
.userdata/<platform>/.hooks/boot.d/00-mounts.sync.sh   applies every layer at boot
.userdata/<platform>/logs/mounts.txt                   every mount change
```

The boot hook runs synchronously, before NextUI starts. No pre-launch or
post-launch hook is installed. `sh .userdata/<platform>/Mounts/mountctl.sh
status` lists what each layer wants mounted and what is live.

Versions before 0.7 installed their own `boot.d/core-saves.sync.sh` hook and a
`boot-mount.sh` helper; opening this version replaces them with the layer.
Reverting removes the layer, and mountctl with it when no other pak still has
one.

Persistent state and the generated mount table live in:

```text
/mnt/SDCARD/.userdata/shared/RetroArch Core Saves/
```

The most recent migration or restore report is saved as:

```text
/mnt/SDCARD/.userdata/shared/RetroArch Core Saves/conversion-report.txt
```

It records filename collisions, conversion or copy failures, restore mappings,
and any ambiguous, unmatched, or ignored restore files. When a report contains
issues, the completion dialog displays the issue count and report location.

## Reverting to normal NextUI behavior

Restore only considers cores mapped by emulator paks currently installed on the
device. A core used by one system restores directly to that system's `/Saves`
folder. When several systems share a core, each save is restored only when its
filename matches a ROM in exactly one corresponding `/Roms/... (<tag>)` folder.
For zipped ROMs, matching accepts the exact names MinArch can derive by removing
the archive extension alone or by removing both the archive and enclosed ROM
extensions. It does not use fuzzy or filename-prefix matching.
Ambiguous and unmatched files, along with files in unmapped core folders, remain
untouched in `/Saves/Cores` and are listed in the conversion report.

Reverting removes the folder mapping and attempts to match save files to on-device ROMs so save files end up in the correct places. It should ignore folders in `/Saves/Cores` that do not match known on-device emulation cores. Reverting does not delete any data in `/Saves/Cores/.`

## Save Ownership and Backups

NextUI owns the normal `/Saves/<tag>` folders, so save game conversion may update
save files throughout `/Saves` (excluding `/Saves/Cores`). When core mounts are
active, the files may be shared with other devices. Conversion therefore warns
about sync compatibility and touches only core directories referenced by the
active mount table; unrelated directories under `/Saves/Cores` are ignored.

Every migration, restore, or in-place conversion first creates a backup under:

```text
/mnt/SDCARD/.core-saves-backups/
```

The five newest completed backups are retained. Failed, incomplete backups are
removed instead of counting toward that limit.

Enable, restore, and in-place conversion operations also use a small durable
operation journal. It
records the operation, current phase, pre-operation control files, and the
backup path. If an error occurs after changes begin, the pak immediately rolls
back the save tree, format setting, mount table, enabled state, and mount layer.
Conversion rollback is limited to the exact source and destination files in its
conversion plan, so unrelated saves—including files that arrive through
Syncthing while conversion runs—are not replaced from the backup.

If the process or device stops before that can happen, opening the pak again
detects the unfinished journal and performs the same recovery before showing
the menu. The conversion report remains the human-readable account of mappings,
results, and problems; it is not used as recovery state.



## Save Formats

NextUI formats are:

- `0`: MinUI, raw SRAM named `Game.gba.sav`
- `1`: RetroArch compressed, RZIP data named `Game.srm`
- `2`: Generic, raw SRAM named `Game.sav`
- `3`: RetroArch uncompressed, raw SRAM named `Game.srm`

Moving formats `0` or `2` into the core tree changes the setting to format `3`
and renames the files. Their SRAM payload is not transformed. Format `1` is
kept compressed and must not be treated as a raw `.sav` merely by renaming it.

When reverting while Generic format is active, RZIP-compressed `.srm` files are
decoded and raw `.srm` payloads pass through unchanged before being named
`.sav`. Reverting while an `.srm` format is active retains the payload encoding.

Raw save compatibility is still core-dependent. A save produced by one
libretro core is not guaranteed to load in a different core for the same
console. RTC files, memory cards, and other files in the save directory are
copied alongside SRAM.

Avoid having two devices write the same game save concurrently. Bind mounts do
not add a new SyncThing compatibility issue, but they also cannot prevent a
normal SyncThing conflict or a sync taken while an emulator is writing a file.

## Folder Mapping

Installed emulator paks are discovered from their `EMU_EXE=` setting and
converted to the core's exact `retro_system_info.library_name`, which is the
folder name RetroArch and MinArch actually use. Every core shipped in NextUI
Base and Extras is covered, along with the pak-store cores whose names have been
verified against core source.

An `EMU_EXE` value that is not recognized is **not** guessed at. That tag is left
unmapped, its saves stay in `/Saves/<tag>`, and the conversion report names the
emulator and asks you to add an override. Falling back to the `EMU_EXE` spelling
would create a folder the emulator never writes to and silently split your saves
across two locations. A pak with no `EMU_EXE` at all — a standalone emulator such
as PPSSPP or DraStic, which keeps its own saves — is noted rather than flagged,
since there is nothing to map.

Note that `library_name` is not always the name RetroArch displays, nor the
`corename` in libretro's `.info` metadata: FreeIntv reports `freeintv`. On device
you can read the real value with
`strings /path/to/<core>_libretro.so | grep -i <core>`.

Custom overrides go in `mapping.conf`:

```text
TAG=RetroArch core folder
```

For example:

```text
GBA=gpSP
GB=Gambatte
GBC=Gambatte
SFC=Snes9x
```

Overrides take precedence over the built-in mapping, so they also let you
correct an entry that turns out to be wrong without waiting for a release.

## Installation

0. Mount your SD card.
1. Download the release archive. GitHub replaces spaces with periods on upload,
   so it downloads as `RetroArch.Core.Saves.pak.zip`.
2. Create the folder `Tools/<PLATFORM>/RetroArch Core Saves.pak` on the SD card.
3. Extract the archive into that folder, so that `launch.sh`, `pak.json`,
   and `bin/` sit directly inside it. 
4. Safely unmount your SD card, insert it into device, enjoy

The folder may be renamed (for example to control menu ordering); the pak reads
its own folder name and the installed mount layer is generated to match.

`<PLATFORM>` should match your device:

- `tg5040` for TrimUI Brick or TrimUI Smart Pro.
- `tg5050` for TrimUI Smart Pro S.
- `h700` for the Anbernic RG XX family.
- `my285` for the Miyoo Mini Flip.

Each supported platform has its own binaries under `bin/<PLATFORM>`, and the pak
refuses to run on anything else rather than guessing. Library search paths are
also per-platform, matching what that platform's own launcher exports: h700
resolves `libGLESv2` and `libsamplerate` from the device's aarch64 multiarch
directories, which the other platforms do not have.

## Dependencies

The platform binaries are from the MIT-licensed projects:

- `josegonzalez/minui-list` 
- `josegonzalez/minui-presenter` 
- `jqlang/jq`

Their license texts are included under `bin/`.

## Tests

Run all suites with `make test` (the Core Saves, mount and Core States suites), or the host-side migration suite alone with:

```sh
"RetroArch Core Saves.pak/bin/tests/test-core-saves.sh"
```

`bin/tests/test-core-saves-mounts.sh` re-runs itself under `unshare -rm`, a
private user and mount namespace, to make real bind mounts without root: moving
a 0.6 install onto mountctl, re-applying with the tag folders mounted, boot,
refusing to hide files, and reverting.

The suite uses the host executables in `bin/desktop/`, reached through the same
`PATH`-based command lookup used on device.

## Release Archive

Build the release zip from committed files with:

```sh
make release
```

This uses `git archive`, so uncommitted and untracked changes are intentionally
excluded. To package the current working tree instead, use:

```sh
make dev
```

`make release` writes `dist/RetroArch Core Saves.pak.zip`; `make dev` writes
`RetroArch Core Saves.pak.zip` beside the pak. Both archives are flat. Development-only findings, desktop binaries, tests, Git metadata, and `bin/SHA256SUMS` are excluded.

## To Do:

- Add a save-format audit: report which files under `/Saves` are `.srm`,
  compressed `.srm`, `.sav`, or `.<ext>.sav`, flag any that disagree with the
  configured `saveFormat`, and offer to align them. Conversion currently refuses
  to run when it meets a file it cannot name (for example a format-`0` `.sav`
  with no ROM extension to strip) and lists it in
  `logs/core-saves-conversion-unresolved.txt`, but it cannot yet tell you the
  overall shape of the save tree before you start.
- Right now the last five backups are preserved. Need to make this user editable.
